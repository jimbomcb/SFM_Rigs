*rig_blackmesa*
-
Rigging for Black Mesa models! Requires an installed and mounted version of the [Black Mesa mod](http://blackmesasource.com).

This is an all-in-one script that works with multiple models. This is my attempt at rigging all current models which aren't functional with the standard biped rig.

Currently supports:

Aliens:

* Alient Grunt  
> Known Issues
  * IK rigging on the legs have some issues, their legs have 3 bones whereas our IK rigs only support 2 bones.
* Bullsquid
* Gargantua
* Houndeye

Humans:

* Assassin 
> Features
  * Support for cloaking. When the rig is added to the assassin, there will be a new AssassinCloak controller, allowing you to control the levels of the cloaking through the graph editor.  

Robots:

* Loader
> Known Issues
  * Piston bones are not able to attach to the IK bones correctly, these will either have to be animated manually or removed from the scene.
